# postgres_integer_to_bigint

**This script has only been used once. It is not maintained. It is not tested for all possible circumstances. Do not rely on it without very careful checking of the results.**

Parses a SQL script generated by `pg_dump` and replaces all integer primary keys of name "id" with bigints, taking
care of all of their foreign keys as well.

This only works properly for database layouts generated by Django, since it does not support all PostgreSQL
features.

Usage:

    convert.py schema.sql > schema_bigint.sql
