# postgres_integer_to_bigint

Parses a SQL script generated by `pg_dump` and replaces all integer primary keys of name "id" with bigints, taking
care of all of their foreign keys as well.

This only works properly for database layouts generated by Django, since it does not support all PostgreSQL
features.

Usage:

    convert.py schema.sql > schema_bigint.sql
